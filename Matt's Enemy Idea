My idea for an enemy is one that could either move back and forth or stay still.
This enemy would constantly put out an AOE around it that would change layers with it every few seconds.
When it changes colors it would wait a second so that the player could change in time.
This enemy could pose to be a chalenge by forcing the player to quickly go past it or be forced to fall down into a different, less desireable area.
