# Put your scripts here!!!
Click upload files and drag your script in.
Use C#, not Java.
put '//By:YOUR_NAME' at the beggining of your script.
If you change someone's script, put '//Cange by YOUR_NAME' above it.
MAKE COMMENTS SO OTHERS CAN SEE YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS!!!.
Make sure to look at the to-do list to see what we need to do.
Just put your name next to one to indicate you are working on it.
Make sure you put the date you claimed it next to your name.
Put the date completed next to that, if not yet completed, put ongoing next to it.
If you are sill working on one by a week, we might have a talk.
I will have an example syntax on it, and feel free to add to the list.
